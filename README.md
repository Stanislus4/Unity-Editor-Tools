### Set Parent
Simplify the organization of your hierarchy by setting a common parent for selected GameObjects. Just drag and drop the parent GameObject and click a button to make your selection its children.

Effortlessly swap selected GameObjects in your hierarchy with a specified prefab. This tool ensures that the transform components are preserved during the replacement.

Sort the immediate children of a selected GameObject in the hierarchy alphabetically by name. Future updates may include the ability to sort non-direct children as well.
